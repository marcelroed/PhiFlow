    "## 2. Constructing geometry\n",

    "\n",
    "Define a class `Triangle` that extends the `Geometry` class. The `Triangle` class should have the following methods:\n",
    "* An `__init__` constructor that takes three points as its input. You may assume that they are given in counter-clockwise order, and don't overlap. Your constructor should store these points as a single `Tensor` with shape `instance('vertex')` and `channel(vector='x,y')`.\n",
    "* Properties `shape`, `volume`, `shape_type`, and `center`. These are functions with no arguments that are decorated with the `@property` decorator.\n",
    "* Methods `__variable_attrs__`, `lies_inside` (use barycentric coordinates), `bounding_radius`, and `bounding_half_extent`.\n",
    "* The most difficult method to implement will be `approximate_signed_distance`. Make sure your code is entirely vectorized. There should be no loops in your solution. Make sure that the result is the _signed_ distance. You can find the formula for the distance between a line segment and a point online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Look at the implementation of `Box` and `Sphere` in `phi/geom/geometry.py`.\n",
    "`__variable_attrs__` can return `('_points',)` as a tuple.\n",
    "For implementing `approximate_signed_distance`, you need conditional logic without using `if`-statements, which is accomplished with `math.where`. You can also use `math.all` to deal with the case where one of the points is equal to a row of the `location` `Tensor`."

Your velocity field should be a `StaggeredGrid` initialized as `(0., 0.)` everywhere, but should have boundary conditions of `(0., 0.5)` on the bottom boundary, `GRAD_ZERO` on top, and zero on the sides.\n",
